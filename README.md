With Django, you can take web applications from concept to launch in a matter of hours. It's a free and open-source framework that's designed on top of Python and supports data-driven architecture. In this course, learn what you need to know to get up and running with Django. Instructor Caleb Smith walks through creating a brand-new Django project, defining a data model and fields, querying the database, and using the framework's built-in URL handlers, views, and templates to structure the rest of the back end. Plus, learn how to incorporate CSS and JavaScript to enhance the style and usability of your Django templates.
